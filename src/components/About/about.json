My resources are mainly Free Code Camp and Youtube (e.g Web Dev Simplified) and currently Hackerank. I have been doing this as a hobby for quite some time but I decided to make it into a career around October, 2022. In the beggining I played with Python for a bit, then learnt PHP which I planned to use to  create a transcription service website which I'm still developing. You can check out my Github to see some of my work."},
